# homework-two

This is homework-two. This was used to use jQuery, and use a basic model view controller to access and manipulate data.

I had an issue with fonts... I downloaded a font off Google Fonts, imported it properly I beleive, and assigned it to a font-face. On preview it worked, but when I opened it in web4, it did not. I instead used a style link from google and got it to work that way.
